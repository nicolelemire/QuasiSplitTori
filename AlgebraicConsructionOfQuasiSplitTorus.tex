The main purpose of this work is to give a constructive proof for a 
particular case of the no-name lemma. Let $G$ be a
finite group, $K$ be a field, $L$ be a permutation $G$-lattice 
and $K[L]$ be the group algebra of $L$ over
$K$. The no-name lemma asserts that the invariant field of the
quotient field of $K[L]$, $K(L)^G$ is a purely transcendental
extension of $K^G$. In other words, there exist $y_1, \ldots , y_n$
which are algebraically independent over $K^G$ such that $K(L)^G \cong
K^G(y_1, \ldots , y_n)$.  We define elements $\lbrace y_1, \ldots, y_n
\rbrace \subset K[L]^G$ with the desired properties, in the case when
$G$ is the Galois group of a finite extension $\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, and
%is given as a group of (signed) permutation matrices.
$L$ is a sign permutation $G$-lattice.

\section{Introduction}


An algebraic $F$-torus $T$ is an algebraic group defined over a field
$F$ which {\em splits} over an algebraic closure $\bar F$ of $F$, that
is, which is isomorphic to a torus (a finite product of copies of the
multiplicative group $\mathbb{G}_m$) over $\bar{F}$. In general,
$\bar{F}$ is not the smallest field over which $T$ splits: it is known
that an algebraic $F$-torus $T$ splits over a finite Galois extension
of $F$. There is a unique minimal such extension, say $K$; if $G =
\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, then $G$ is called the splitting group of $T$. For
more details, 
%see~\cite[Chapter 2]{Voskresenskii}.
see~\cite[p. 27]{Voskresenskii}.

For a finite group $G$, a $G$-lattice $L$ is a free $\Z$-module $A$ of
finite rank, together with a group homomorphism $G \longrightarrow
{\rm Aut}(A)$ (the group of automorphisms of $A$). Given a module
basis of $A$, any group homomorphism $G \longrightarrow {\rm
  GL}(n,\Z)$, with $n={\rm rank}(A)$, gives such an action.  If $K$ is
a field, the group algebra $K[L]$ of $L$ over $K$ is isomorphic to the
$K$-algebra of Laurent polynomials $K[x_1^{\pm 1},\dots,x_n^{\pm 1}]$,
for some indeterminates $x_1,\dots,x_n$.  If $K$ is equipped with an
action of $G$ (that is, a $G$-field), we can extend the action of $G$
on lattice $L$ to an action on $K[L]$; the ring $K[L]^G$ of {\em
  multiplicative invariants} consists of those elements in $K[L]$
invariant under the action of $G$. The fraction field $K(L)$ of $K[L]$
is isomorphic to $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, and the subfield of invariants
under the action of $G$ is written $K(L)^G$.

It is known that there is a duality between the category of algebraic
tori with splitting group $G$ and $G$-lattices. For a given algebraic
torus $T$ with splitting group $G$, its character module
$\mathrm{Hom}(T,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is a $G$-lattice. Conversely, if $L$ is
a $G$-lattice, with $G={\rm Gal}(K/F)$ for some finite Galois
extension $K/F$, then $T=\mathrm{Spec}(K[L]^G)$ is an algebraic
$F$-torus with splitting group $G$, coordinate ring $K[L]^G$ and
function field $K(L)^G$.

A $G$-lattice $L$ is called {\em permutation} (resp.\ {\em sign
  permutation}) if it has a $\Z$-basis which is permuted (resp.\ up to
sign changes) by $G$. In particular, an algebraic torus whose
corresponding $G$-lattice is a permutation lattice is called a {\em
  quasi-split torus}. Quasi-split algebraic tori 
  %Algebraic tori
  are characterized as being
representable as a direct product of groups of the form
$R_{E/F}(\mathbb{G}_m)$, where $R_{E/F}$ is the Weil restriction with 
respect to a finite separable field extension $E/F$.
Note that $R_{E/F}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ is a $F$-group scheme with $F$-points $E^{\times}$ and 
character lattice $\Z[G/H]$, where $K/F$ is a Galois closure of $E/F$, $G={\rm Gal}(K/F)$ and $H$ is the 
subgroup of $G$ which fixes the subfield $E$.
%(so
%that $R_{K/F}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ is an $F$-group scheme).
The Weil restriction here is not necessarily with respect to a finite Galois extension $K/F$
as this would only produce character lattices which are direct sums of the group ring.

 %%to which we refer by the same name, 

A specific case of the no-name lemma asserts that if $L$ is a
permutation $G$-lattice and $K$ is a $G$-field, then $K(L)^G$ is
rational over $K^G$~\cite[Chapter~9.4]{Lorenz}; in particular, with
$G={\rm Gal}(K/F)$, $K(L)^G$ is $F$-rational. The term "no-name lemma"
was first used by Dolgachev in \cite{Dolgachev}, expressing the fact
that many researchers discovered the result independently. It is
actually more general than the stated version here; see
\cite[p.\ 6]{Dolgachev}, \cite[Section 3.2]{Sansuc}, \cite[Proposition
  1.3]{Lenstra}, \cite[Remark 2.4]{Domokos} and \cite[Proposition
  1.1]{EndoMiyata}.  In this paper, we give a constructive proof of
the particular case described above (and of a slight generalization
thereof, using signed permutation matrices), by exhibiting a basis for
such a field of invariants.  In concrete terms, we start from a
subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ and describe the field of functions of
an associated torus.

\begin{definition}\label{Assumption}
  Let $G$ be a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$.  The
  $G$-lattice $L_G$ corresponding to $G$ is the rank $n$ lattice
  $\Z^n=\{[a_1,\dots,a_n]^T: a_i\in \Z\}$ on which $G$ acts naturally by left-multiplication.
  Note that $\Z^n$ has a standard basis $\{\be_i: i=1,\dots,n\}$, 
  %generated by the standard basis $\langle \be_i : i = 1,
  %\ldots, n \rangle_\Z$, 
  where $\be_i$ is the column vector
  $[\delta_{i,j}, i=1,\dots,n]^T$.
  %together with the action of $G$ given
  %by left-multiplication on the $\be_i$'s.
\end{definition}

Suppose further that we are given an isomorphism $\iota: G \to
\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, for some finite Galois extension $K/F$ (in what
follows, we simply say that $K/F$ has Galois group $G$). Then, through
the identification $K[x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots , x_n^{\pm 1}]\simeq K[L_G]$,
$K[x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots , x_n^{\pm 1}]$ is equipped with the $G$-action
defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item for $g$ in $G$ and $\alpha$ in $K$, we write
  $g(\alpha)=(\iota(g))(\alpha)$ (so $G$ acts as the Galois group on
  $K$);
\item for $g$ in $G$ and $j=1,\dots,n$, $g(x_i) = \prod_{j=1}^{n}
  x_j^{g_{j,i}}$, where $g_{j,i}$ is the $(j,i)$th -entry of $g$
 (so that we also have $g(\be_i) =
  \sum_{j=1}^{n} g_{j,i}\be_j$).
\end{itemize}
If we let $T_G$ be the algebraic torus corresponding to $L_G$, then
$T_G$ is an algebraic $F$-torus which splits over $K$, with character
lattice $L_G$ and function field $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)^G$.

Conjugate subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\Z)$ correspond to isomorphic
lattices, and isomorphic algebraic tori; in particular, for $G$ a
finite subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$, $L_G$ is a (signed)
permutation lattice if and only if $G$ is conjugate to a group of
(signed) permutation matrices.  Computationally, we do not have an
efficient algorithm at hand to decide whether a given lattice is
(signed) permutation. Hence, in our main results, we will assume that
$G$ is a subgroup of the group $\mathbb{S}_n$ of permutation matrices
of size $n$, or more generally of the group $\mathbb{B}_n$ of signed
permutation matrices of size $n$.  In such a case, for $i$ in
$\{1,\dots,n\}$ and $g$ in $G$, $g(\be_i)=\pm \be_j$ for some index
$j$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ (all signs being $+1$ if $G$ is a subgroup of
$\mathbb{S}_n$), and the action of $g \in G$ on $x_i$ is given
by $$g(x_i) = \begin{cases} x_j & \text{if~} g(\be_i) = \be_j
  \\ x^{-1}_j & \text{if~} g(\be_i) = -\be_j. \end{cases}$$

For such groups $G$, the $F$-rationality of the torus $T_{G}$ means
that for $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, endowed with the $G$-action we just
described, there exist algebraically independent $y_1,\dots,y_n$ in 
$K(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ such that $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)^G=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$. 
However, the proofs of the no-name lemma we are aware of
are nonconstructive.  The goal of this paper is to exhibit such 
an algebraically independent set $\{y_i:i=1,\dots,n\}$; we
state two such results. Note that the first result is a special case of
 the general version of the no-name lemma. In particular, this can be 
 applied to get an explicit transcendence basis of the function field 
 of a quasi-split algebraic torus $T_G$, provided $G$ is given as a group 
 of permutation matrices.

In both our theorems, we rely on the notion of a {\em normal element} of
a finite Galois extension $K/F$ with Galois group $G$; we recall that
$\alpha \in K$ is normal if $\alpha$ and all its Galois conjugates
form an $F$-basis of $K$.  Any finite Galois extension admits a normal
element~\cite[Theorem 6.13.1]{Lang}; there exist algorithms to
construct one, in characteristic zero~\cite{Girstmair} or in positive
characteristic~\cite{Giesbrecht,Poli}.

\begin{theorem}\label{nonamenonsign}
  Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\mathbb{S}_n$, let $K/F$ be a finite
  Galois extension with Galois group $G$, and let $\alpha \in K$ be a
  normal element for $K/F$. Then $ K(x_1,\ldots ,
  x_n)^G=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, with
  $$y_i =\sum_{g \in G} g(\alpha x_i), \quad i = 1,\dots,n.$$
\end{theorem}

Our second statement is similar, but deals with the more general case
of signed permutations (if the group $G$ below happens to be a subgroup of $\mathbb{S}_n$,  
%non-signed permutation, 
the construction is not the same as in the previous theorem).

\begin{theorem}\label{nonamesign}
  Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\mathbb{B}_n$, let $K/F$ be a finite
  Galois extension with Galois group $G$, and let $\alpha \in K$ be a
  normal element for $K/F$. Then
  $K(x_1,\ldots, x_n)^G = F(y_1, \ldots, y_{n}),$
  with $$y_i = \sum_{g \in G} g\left (\frac{\alpha}{1+x_i}\right), \quad i = 1,\dots,n.$$
\end{theorem}

There are many algorithms for finding the invariant rings for
polynomial invariants~\cite{Sturmfels,Kemper2}. For multiplicative
invariants, the algorithmic landscape is not developed to the same
extent. In \cite{Renault} the author introduced an algorithm to 
compute a generating set for the ring of multiplicative invariants, 
when the acting group is a subgroup of a reflection group. A more 
general algorithm for computing the ring of multiplicative invariants
 is given by Kemper in \cite{Kemper}. It is worth mentioning that although 
both above algorithms may be applied to our problem, they 
will not necessarily produce a transcendence basis of the invariant field.

\section{Proofs and examples}


In what follows, we use the following notation: we still write
$\mathbb{S}_n$, resp.\ $\mathbb{B}_n$, for the groups of permutation,
resp.\ signed permutation matrices of size $n$. Note that $\mathbb{D}_n$, the group of  diagonal matrices 
in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\Z)$ (diagonal matrices with entries in $\{\pm 1\}$) is a normal subgroup of $\mathbb{B}_n$
such that $\mathbb{B}_n=\mathbb{D}_n\rtimes \mathbb{S}_n$ is a semidirect product.
We let $\mathfrak{S}_n$ be the symmetric group of size $n$.  Since $\mathbb{S}_n$ is naturally isomorphic to 
$\mathfrak{S}_n$, we see that there is a natural group homomorphism  
$\rho: \mathbb{B}_n \to \mathfrak{S}_n$ 
obtained by mapping a signed permutation matrix to the permutation
$\rho_g$ such that $\rho_g(i)=j$, where $j$ is the index of the
unique non-zero entry in the $i$th column of $g$.  Note that the kernel of the group homomorphism is $\mathbb{D}_n$. %(\we 
%$\mathfrak{S}_n$ be the symmetric group of size $n$ and we denote by
%$\rho: \mathbb{B}_n \to \mathfrak{S}_n$ the group homomorphism
%obtained by mapping a signed permutation matrix to the permutation
%$\rho_g$ such that $\rho_g(i)=j$, where $j$ is the index of the
%unique non-zero entry in the $i$th column of $g$.  
Hence, in terms of
the action defined in the previous section, for $g$ in $\mathbb{B}_n$
and for all $i,j$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, we have $g(x_i) =
x_{\rho_g(i)}^{\pm 1}$.  For $i,j$ as above, we also denote by
$G^{\pm}_{i,j}$ the set of all $g$ in $G$ such that $g(x_i)=x^{\pm 1}_j$, that is,
such that $\rho_g(i)=j$.
%% \textbf{Changed notation here to not duplicate permutation case notation}.

We start with a lemma that generalizes known facts about Moore
matrices over finite fields (see Example~\ref{ex:Moore} below). Let
$G$ be a subgroup of $\mathbb{B}_n$ and let $K/F$ be a finite Galois
extension with Galois group isomorphic to $G$, as in the previous
section. Through this isomorphism, $G$ acts on (column) vectors
entrywise: for $g \in G$ and a column vector in $K^m$, written as $C =
\left[\mu_{1} \,\,\, \mu_{2} \,\,\, \cdots \,\,\, \mu_{m}\right]^T$,
we define $g(C) = \left[g(\mu_{1}) \,\,\, g(\mu_{2}) \,\,\, \cdots
  \,\,\, g(\mu_{m})\right]^T$.

Let then $M$ be in $M_{n,n}(K)$. For such a matrix, and for
$i=1,\dots,n$, its $i$th column is written $M_i=\left[\mu_{1,i} \,\,\,
  \mu_{2,i} \,\,\, \cdots \,\,\, \mu_{m,j}\right]^T$.  We say that $G$
{\em permutes the columns of $M$ up to sign} if for $g$ in $G$ and $i$
in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, we have $g(M_i)= \pm M_{\rho_g(i)}$.
 
\begin{lemma}\label{signdet}
   Let $K/F$ be a finite Galois extension with Galois group $G$. Let
   $M$ be in $M_{n,n}(K)$ and assume that $G$ permutes the columns of
   $M$ up to sign. Assume also that the entries of the first column
 of $M$ are $F$-linearly independent. Then $M$ is invertible.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Assume by contradiction that there is a non-zero vector in the left
  nullspace of $M$; take $\bx \in K^n$ to be a vector with the minimum number of
  non-zero entries among the non-zero left nullspace elements
  (that is, such that $\bx^T M=0$).
  Let $k \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ be such that $x_k \neq 0$ and let
  $\by=\frac 1{x_k} \bx \in K^n$, so that $y_k = 1$, and $\by$ is
  still in the left nullspace of $M$. 
  
  For $i$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, we have the equality $\by^T M_i = 0 $,
  where $M_i$ is the $i$th column of $M$. For $g$ in $G$, we deduce
  $g(\by^T M_i) = g(\by)^Tg(M_i) = \pm g(\by)^T M_{\rho_g(i)} = 0$. Since
  this is true for all $i$, we obtain that $g(\by)$ is in the
  left nullspace of $M$ as well. This further implies that
  $\by'=g(\by)-\by$ is in the left nullspace of $M$. However, since
  $y_k=1$, $g(y_k)=1$, so that $y'_k=0$. By construction of $\bx$, this
  implies that $\by'=0$, so that $g(\by)=\by$. 

  Since this is true for all $g$, we deduce that $\by$ is in $F^n$.
  Then, the relation $\by^T M_1=0$ implies that $\by=0$, a
  contradiction.
 \end{proof} 

\begin{remark}
The hypotheses in the above lemma imply that the induced unsigned
action of the group $G$ on the columns of $M$ is a transitive action.
Let $H=\mathrm{Stab}_G(M_1)$. Then $h\in H$ fixes $M_1$ and so $M_1\in
(K^H)^n$.  But then the $n$ entries of $M_1$ are contained in $K^H$
and are also $F$-linearly independent.  The size of an $F$-linearly
independent set in $K^H$ can be at most $[K^H:F]$.  Then $n\le
[K^H:F]=[K^H:K^G]=[G:H]\le n$ implies that $[G:H]=n$.  But then the
orbit of $M_1$ under the action of $G$ has size
$[G:H]=[G:\mathrm{Stab}_G(M_1)]=n$.
\end{remark}  

\begin{example}\label{ex:Moore}
  Let $F=\F_q$, for some prime power $q$, and let $K=\F_{q^n}$.  The
  Galois group of $K/F$ is cyclic of size $n$, generated by the Frobenius
  map $x \mapsto x^q$. Let then $(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ be in $K$,
  and consider the {\em Moore matrix} $M=[m_{i,j}]_{1 \le i,j \le n}$, with
  $m_{i,j} = \alpha_i^{q^{j-1}}$. The Frobenius map permutes the
  columns of $M$, and we recover the fact that if
  $(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ are $F$-linearly independent, $M$ is
  invertible~\cite[Corollary~1.3.4]{Goss}.
\end{example}


We can now prove our first result.

%% \begin{theorem}\label{theo:1}
%%   Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\mathbb{S}_n$, let $K/F$ be a finite
%%   Galois extension with Galois group $G$, and let $\alpha \in K$ be a
%%   normal element for $K/F$. Then $ K(x_1,\ldots ,
%%   x_n)^G=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, with
%%   $$y_i =\sum_{g \in G} g(\alpha x_i), \quad i =
%%   1,\dots,n.$$
%% \end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}]
  We first prove the result under the additional assumption that $G$
  acts transitively on $L_G$.  The elements $(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, with
  $y_i = \sum_{g \in G} g(\alpha x_i)$ as defined in the theorem, are
  invariant under the action of $G$. We will show below that
  $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)=K(y_1,\dots,y_n)$; this will prove that
  $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)^G=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$, since
  $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)=K(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ implies that
  $K(y_1,\dots,y_n)^G=K^G(y_1,\dots,y_n)=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$.

  For $i,j$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $G_{i,j}= \lbrace g \in G: g(x_i)
  = x_j \rbrace$, so that we can rewrite $y_i$ as $$y_i = \sum^n_{j
    =1}\sum_{g \in G_{i,j}}g(\alpha)x_j, \,\,\, i = 1, \ldots, n.$$
  Note that $G_{i,i}=\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i)$ and so is a subgroup of $G$. Since the action of $G$ on $L_G$ is 
  transitive, $G_{i,j}$ is
  non-empty for every $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. Take such indices $i,j$,
  and fix some $g_{i,j}$ in $G_{i,j}$. If $g \in G_{i,j}$, then
  $g^{-1}_{i,j}g(x_i) = x_i$ shows that $g$ is in
  $g_{i,j}G_{i,i}$. Since we also have
  $g_{i,j}G_{i,i} \subseteq G_{i,j}$, we see that
  $G_{i,j} = g_{i,j}G_{i,i}$.

 % Since the action of $G$ on $L_G$ is transitive, $G_{i,j}$ is
  %non-empty for every $1 \leq i,j \leq n$.  Take such indices $i,j$,
  %and fix some $g_{i,j}$ in $G_{i,j}$. If $g \in G_{i,j}$, then
  %$g^{-1}_{i,j}g(x_i) = x_i$ shows that $g$ is in
  %$g_{i,j}\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i)$. Since we also have
  %$g_{i,j}\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i) \subseteq G_{i,j}$, we see that
  %$G_{i,j} = g_{i,j}\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i)$.


  We now show that the matrix $M$ with $i$th row the coordinate vector
  of $y_i$ with respect to the $K$-basis $\lbrace x_1, \ldots x_n
  \rbrace$ is invertible. The matrix $M$ has entries $m_{i,j} =
  \sum_{g \in G_{i,j}}g(\alpha)$, $i,j = 1, \ldots, n$. We will apply
  Lemma~\ref{signdet} to show that $M$ is invertible, which is sufficient to 
  prove the theorem.

  We check the hypothesis of the lemma. First, let $\rho: G \to
  \mathfrak{S}_n$, $\rho(g) = \rho_g$ be the group homomorphism that
  corresponds to the action of $G$ on $(x_1, \ldots , x_n)$, so that
  $\rho_g(i) = j$ if and only if $g(x_i) = x_j$ for all $1 \leq
  i,j\leq n$. We will show that the columns of $M$ are permuted by the
  action of $G$. Let thus $h$ be in $G$. Note that for $g$ in
  $G_{i,j}$, $hg$ is in $G_{i,\rho_h(j)}$.
  Then since $G_{i,j}=g_{i,j}G_{i,i}$ is a left coset of $G_{i,i}$ where $g_{i,j}$
is an arbitrary element of $G_{i,j}$, we see that $hG_{i,j}=hg_{i,j}G_{i,i}=G_{i,\rho_h(j)}$ 
since $hg_{ij}\in G_{i,\rho_h(j)}$.  We then get
  %since $G_{i,\rho_h(j)}$ and
  %$G_{i,j}$ have the same cardinality, equal to
  %$|\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i)|$, we get
  $$h(m_{i,j}) = \sum_{g \in G_{i,j}}hg(\alpha) = \sum_{\sigma \in
    G_{i, \rho_{h}(j)}}\sigma (\alpha) = m_{i,\rho_{h}}(j).$$ This
  shows that $h(M_j) = M_{\rho_h(j)}$ for all $j = 1, \ldots, n$, so
  that $G$ permutes the columns of $M$. 
  
  Finally, the first column $M_1$ has entries $\sum_{g \in
      G_{i,1}}g(\alpha)$, $i = 1, \ldots,n$.  Since $\alpha$ is a
  normal element of the Galois extension $K/F$ with Galois group $G$,
  the set $\lbrace g(\alpha): g \in G \rbrace$ is $F$-linearly
  independent. Since $G = \sqcup^n_{i =1}G_{i,1}$ is a disjoint union,
  and all $G_{i,1}$ are non-empty,
  the set
  $$\left\lbrace \sum_{g \in G_{i,1}}g(\alpha),\ i = 1, \ldots, n
  \right\rbrace$$ is $F$-linearly independent as well.  So
  Lemma~\ref{signdet} applies, and we conclude that $M$ is invertible,
  as claimed.

  \medskip 
  
  We can now give the proof of our claim in the general case.  Let
  $\be_1, \ldots , \be_n$ be the standard basis of $L_G$, and let
  $\{\be_{j_k} \mid k = 1, \ldots, r\}$ and correspondingly $\{x_{j_k}
  \mid k = 1, \ldots, r\}$ be a complete set of $G$-orbit
  representatives among the basis vectors, and the indeterminates
  $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ respectively. Then $L_k = \oplus_{ \be_i \in G
    \be_{j_{k}} } \Z \be_i$ is a transitive permutation $G$-lattice
  for each $k = 1, \ldots, r$, and $K(L_k) = K(x_i \mid x_i \in
  Gx_{j_k})$.
  
  The lattice $L_G = \oplus^r_{k =1} L_k$ is a direct sum of transitive
  permutation $G$-lattices, 
  %and similarly 
  so that $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)$
  %Note superscript G was removed.
  is the
  compositum of the fields $K(L_k)$, $k=1,\dots,r$. Thus, using the 
  result established in the transitive case, we obtain
  $K(x_1,\dots,x_n)^G=F(y_i \mid x_i \in Gx_{j_k}, k=1,\dots,r)$, where
  for all $k$ and for $x_i \in Gx_{j_k}$, we have $y_i=\sum_{g \in G}
  g(\alpha x_i)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{example}
Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^4-2$ over $F=\Q$. Then
$\mathrm{Gal}(K/\Q) \cong D_8$, $K = \Q(\theta,i)$, with $\theta =
\sqrt[4]{2}$, and $\lbrace 1, \theta, \theta^2, \theta^3, i, i\theta,
i\theta^2, i\theta^3\rbrace$, is a $\Q$-basis for $K$. Let
$n=4$, let
$G\leq \mathrm{GL}(4,\Z)$ be generated by
$$
r = \begin{bmatrix}
0&0&0&1\\
1&0&0&0\\
0&1&0&0\\
0&0&1&0
\end{bmatrix} \,\,\,\, \text{and}\,\,\,\,
s = \begin{bmatrix}
1&0&0&0\\
0&0&0&1\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&1&0&0
\end{bmatrix}.
$$ and let $(x_1,\dots,x_4)$ be new indeterminates, on which $G$ acts as in
Definition~\ref{Assumption}; this action is transitive. One can verify
that $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\Q)$; through this isomorphism,
the action of $r$ and $s$ on the generators of $K$ is given by
$$
\begin{matrix}
r(i) = i &r(\theta) = i \theta \\
s(i) = -i & s(\theta) = \theta.
\end{matrix}
$$
Now, define $$\alpha = 1+ \theta + \theta^2 + \theta^3 +i + i\theta + i\theta^2 + i\theta^3=
(\sum_{i=0}^3\theta^i)(1+i);$$
this is a normal element in $K/\Q$. 
Note that $G_{1,1}=\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_1)=\langle s\rangle$. Since $r^i(x_1)=x_{i+1}, i=0,1,2,3$,
we see that $G_{i,i}=\mathrm{Stab}_G(x_i)=r^i \mathrm{Stab}_G(x_1)r^{-i}$ and so $G_{1,1}=G_{3,3}=\langle s\rangle$
and $G_{2,2}=G_{4,4}=\langle r^2s\rangle$. Also note that $r^{j-i}\in G_{i,j}$, where we may consider all exponents of 
$r$ modulo 4.
This shows that the elements $(y_1,\dots,y_4)$ of Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}, expressed 
on the basis $(x_1,\dots,x_4)$, are given by the coordinate matrix
$$
M= \begin{bmatrix}
(1+s)(\alpha) & r(1+s)(\alpha) & r^2(1+s)(\alpha) & r^3(1+s)(\alpha)\\
r^3(1+r^2s)(\alpha) & (1+r^2s)(\alpha) & r(1+r^2s)(\alpha) & r^2(1+r^2s)(\alpha)\\
r^2(1+s)(\alpha) & r^3(1+s)(\alpha) & (1+s)(\alpha) & r(1+s)(\alpha)\\
r(1+r^2s)(\alpha) & r^2(1+r^2s)(\alpha) & r^3(1+r^2s)(\alpha) & (1+r^2s)(\alpha)
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Now since $M_j=r^{j-1}M_1$ for all $j=1,2,3,4$, it is clear that the action of 
$r$ permutes the columns.  In particular, $rM_j=M_{j+1}$ (modulo 4).  One can check that $sM_1=M_1$ and since $|\textrm{Stab}_G(M_1)|=8/4=2$, this shows that $\textrm{Stab}_G(M_1)=\langle s\rangle$.
Then $sr^{j-1}M_1=r^{1-j}sM_1$ shows that $sM_j=M_{5-j},j=1,\dots,4$ so $s$ also permutes the columns of $M$.
%$$
%M= \begin{bmatrix}
%(1+s)(\alpha) & (r^3+sr)(\alpha) & (r^2+sr^2)(\alpha) & (r+sr^3)(\alpha)\\
%(r+sr)(\alpha) & (1+sr^2)(\alpha) & (r^3+sr^3)(\alpha) & (r^2+s)(\alpha)\\
%(r^2+sr^2)(\alpha) & (r+sr^3)(\alpha) & (1+s)(\alpha) & (r^3+sr)(\alpha)\\
%(r^3+sr^3)(\alpha) & (r^2+s)(\alpha) & (r+sr)(\alpha) & (1+sr^2)(\alpha)
%\end{bmatrix}.
%$$
%The action of $r$ and $s$ on the columns is given by

%% and
%% $$s(M_1)=M_1,\quad s(M_2)=M_4,\quad s(M_3)=M_3, \quad s(M_4)=M_2.$$

\begin{remark}
With the assumptions of the previous theorem, we can actually compute
the coordinate ring of the torus; we obtain $$K[L_G]^G \cong K[x^{\pm
    1}_1, x^{\pm 1}_2, \ldots , x^{\pm 1}_n]^G = F[y_1, \ldots ,
  y_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n},$$ for $y_1,\dots,y_n$ as in the theorem.
Indeed, we have $K[x^{\pm 1}_1, x^{\pm 1}_2, \ldots , x^{\pm 1}_n] =
K[x_1, \ldots , x_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n}.$ We are interested in
$K[L_G]^G$, that is, $\left( K[x^{\pm 1}_1, x^{\pm 1}_2, \ldots ,
  x^{\pm 1}_n] \right)^G = \left(K[x_1, \ldots , x_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n}
\right) ^G.$ The proof of Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign} shows that
$K[x_1, \ldots , x_n] = K[y_1, \ldots , y_n]$.  On the other hand
since $G$ permutes the $x_i$'s, $x_1\cdots x_n$ is invariant under the
action of $G$, and we can conclude $$\left( K[x_1, \ldots ,
  x_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n}\right)^G = \left( K[y_1, \ldots ,
  y_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n} \right)^G = K^G [y_1, \ldots , y_n]_{x_1\cdots
  x_n} = F[y_1, \ldots , y_n]_{x_1\cdots x_n}.$$ One could further
rewrite $x_1\cdots x_n$ as a degree $n$ homogeneous polynomial in
$y_1,\dots,y_n$ (but the expression obtained this way is not
particularly handy).
\end{remark}

We conclude with the proof of our second main result.  The proof
follows that of Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}, the only difference being in
the description of the coordinate matrix $M$.  As in
Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}, we first prove the result under the extra
assumption that $G$ acts transitively up to sign on $L_G$.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{nonamesign}]
  Assume first that the action of $G$ is transitive (up to sign).
  For $i$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, define $z_i = (1+x_i)^{-1} $. Then, for $g
  \in G$, $$g(z_i) = \begin{cases} z_j & \text{if} \,\,\, g(x_i) = x_j
    \\ 1-z_j & \text{if} \,\,\, g(x_i) = x_j^{-1},
  \end{cases}$$ 
  and $K(x_1, \ldots , x_n) = K(z_1, \ldots, z_n).$ The elements $y_i$
  can be rewritten as $y_i = \sum_{g \in G} g ({\alpha}z_i)$, for $i$
  in $\{1, \ldots, n\}$; as before, in order to prove that
  $K(z_1,\ldots, z_n)^G = F(y_1, \ldots, y_{n})$, it is enough to
  prove that $K(y_1,\dots,y_n)=K(z_1,\dots,z_n)$. This will be done by
  writing $(1,y_1,\dots,y_n)$ as $K$-linear combinations of
  $(1,z_1,\dots,z_n)$, and proving that the coordinate matrix is
  invertible.

  For $i,j$ in $\lbrace 1, \ldots , n \rbrace$, let $G^{\pm}_{i,j}$
  be defined as in the preamble of this section, that is 
  $G^{\pm}_{i,j}=\lbrace g \in G : g(z_i) = z_j \,\, \text{or} \,\, g(z_i) = 1-z_j
  \rbrace $. By the transitivity assumption, $G^{\pm}_{i,j}$ is
  non-empty for every $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. Let us further define $G^{+}_{i,j}
  = \lbrace g \in G : g(z_i) = z_j \rbrace$ and $G^{-}_{i,j} =
  \lbrace g \in G : g(z_i) = 1- z_j \rbrace$, so that $G_{i,j}=
  G^{+}_{i,j}\sqcup G^{-}_{i,j}$.  

Note that $G^+_{i,i}=\textrm{Stab}_G(z_i)$.  Both $G^{\pm}_{i,i}$ and $G^+_{i,i}$ are subgroups of $G$.  One can show that the left cosets of $G^+_{i,i}$ in $G$ are the non-empty sets in the collection
$$\{G^+_{i,j}:1\le j\le n\} \cup \{G^-_{i,j}: 1\le j\le n\}$$
By the transitivity assumption, the sets $G^{\pm}_{i,j}\ne \emptyset$
so one can guarantee that either $G^+_{i,j}\ne \emptyset$ or $G^-_{i,j}\ne \emptyset$ (although both are possible).  If $G^+_{i,j}\ne \emptyset$, and $g_{ij}^+$ is an arbitrary element of $G^+_{i,j}$, then 
$G^+_{i,j}=g_{ij}^+G^+_{i,j}$ and if $G^-_{i,j}\ne \emptyset$ and $g_{ij}^-$ is an arbitrary element of $G^-_{i,j}$, then 
$G^-_{i,j}=g_{ij}^-G^+_{i,j}$.
  
  Let $M^*$ be the coordinate matrix of $(1, y_1, \ldots,
  y_n)$ with respect to the $K$-basis $(1, z_1, \ldots, z_n)$; 
  we  have to show that $\det (M^*) \neq 0$.
  By definition, for $i$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$, we have
  \begin{align*}
y_i = \sum_{g \in G} g ({\alpha}z_i)&= \sum_{j=1}^n \Big(\sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)z_j +\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)(1-z_j)\Big)\\
&=\sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)+ \sum_{j=1}^n\Big(\sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}g(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)\Big)z_j.
  \end{align*}
For $i,j \in \lbrace1, \ldots , n \rbrace$, define $m_{i,j} =
\sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}g(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)$
and $c_i = \sum_{j=1}^n\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)$. The matrix
$M^*$ is then
$$M^* = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
c_1 & m_{1,1} & \cdots & m_{1,n}\\
\vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots\\
c_{n} & m_{n,1} & \cdots	& m_{n,n}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Let us write
$$M = \begin{bmatrix}
 m_{1,1} & \cdots & m_{1,n}\\
 \vdots &  & \vdots\\
 m_{n,1} & \cdots	& m_{n,n}
\end{bmatrix}.$$
Since $\det(M^*) = \det (M)$, it is enough to show that the
determinant of $M$ is non-zero; this will be done using
Lemma~\ref{signdet}. We now check that the hypotheses of the lemma are
satisfied.

As before, let $\rho: G \to \mathfrak{S}_n$, $\rho(g) =
\rho_g$ be the group homomorphism that corresponds to the action of
$G$ on $\lbrace z_1, \ldots , z_n \rbrace$, so that $\rho_g(i) = j$ if
and only if $g$ is in $G^{\pm}_{i,j}$. We will show that the columns
$M_1,\dots,M_n$ of $M$ are permuted up to sign by the action of $G$.

Let $h$ be in $G$
and  $i,j$ be in $\lbrace 1, \ldots, n \rbrace$. We 
can then write
$$h(m_{i,j}) = h\Big( \sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}g(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in
  G^{-}_{i,j}}g(\alpha)\Big) = \sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha)
-\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha).$$ 
As in the proof of Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}, we have
$hG^{\pm}_{i,j} = G^{\pm}_{i,\rho_h(j)}$, but more precisely, we can write
\begin{align}
\left \{
\begin{array}{ll}
  G^{+}_{i,\rho_{h}(j)}&= hG^{+}_{i,j}\\
G^{-}_{i,\rho_h(j)}&= hG^{-}_{i,j}
\end{array}\right .
\text{~if~} h \in G^+_{j,\rho_h(j)}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\left \{
\begin{array}{cl}
  G^{+}_{i,\rho_{h}(j)}&= hG^{-}_{i,j}\\
G^{-}_{i,\rho_h(j)}&= hG^{+}_{i,j}
\end{array}\right .
\text{~if~} h \in G^-_{j,\rho_h(j)}.
\end{align}
In the first case, we deduce
$$m_{i,\rho_h(j)} =  \sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,\rho_h(j)}}g(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,\rho_h(j)}}g(\alpha) 
                  =  \sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha)
=h(m_{i,j});$$
in the second case, we get
$$m_{i\rho_h(j)} = \sum_{g\in G^{+}_{i,\rho_h(j)}}g(\alpha)
-\sum_{g\in G^{-}_{i,\rho_h(j)}}g(\alpha) = \sum_{g\in
  G^{-}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha) -\sum_{g\in
  G^{+}_{i,j}}hg(\alpha)=-h(m_{i,j}).$$ In other words, $h(M_j) = \pm
M_{\rho_h(j)}$, so $G$ permutes the columns of $M$ up to sign.
Secondly, the first column $M_1$ has entries 
$$\sum_{g \in G^{+}_{i,1}}g(\alpha)- \sum_{g \in
  G^{-}_{i,1}}g(\alpha), i = 1, \ldots,n.$$ Since $\alpha$ is a normal
element of the Galois extension $K/F$ with Galois group $G$, and since
$G = \sqcup^n_{i =1}G^{\pm}_{i,j}= \sqcup^n_{i =1}(G^{+}_{i,1} \sqcup
G^{-}_{i,1}) $ is a disjoint union, with all $G^{\pm}_{i,j}$ non-empty (by
the transitivity of the action), this set is $F$-linearly independent.

So Lemma \ref{signdet} applies, and we conclude that $K(y_1, \ldots,
y_n)=K(z_1,\dots,z_n)$; this implies that
$K(x_1,\dots,x_n)^G=F(y_1,\dots,y_n)$.  This finishes the proof in the
transitive case; the proof in the general case follows as in
Theorem~\ref{nonamenonsign}.
\end{proof}


\begin{example}
Let $K= \Q(\rho)$, where $\rho$ is a primitive $5$-th root of unity,
so that $K/\Q$ is Galois, with $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\Q) \cong C_4$.
Take $n=3$, assume $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(3,\Z)$ is generated by $$
\sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
0&-1&0\\
1&0&0\\
0&0&-1
\end{bmatrix}$$ and let $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ be
indeterminates over $K$, on which $G$ acts as in Definition~\ref{Assumption};
this action is not transitive.
One can also verify that $G$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\Q)$;
$\sigma(\rho)=\rho^2$.  This implies that $\sigma^k(\rho)=\rho^{2^k}$, $k=0,1,2,3$.
In particular, $\sigma^3(\rho)=\rho^{8}=\rho^3$.

We choose $\rho$ as our normal element of the extension $K/\Q$.
(A primitive $p$th root of unity is a normal element for the extension over $\Q$ that it generates.)

In this example, note that $G^+_{1,1}=G^+_{2,2}=\{\mathrm{id}\}$, $G^-_{1,1}=G^-{2,2}=\{\sigma^2\}$, $G^+_{1,2}=G^-_{2,1}=\{\sigma\}$, and $G^-_{1,2}=G^+_{2,1}=\{\sigma^3\}$. Also, $G^+_{3,3}=\langle\sigma^2\rangle$ and $G^-_{3,3}=\sigma G^+_{3,3}=
\langle \sigma,\sigma^3\}$.

With $(z_1,z_2,z_3)$ and $(y_1,y_2,y_3)$
defined as before, the matrix $M^*$ giving the coordinates of
$(1,y_1,y_2,y_3)$ on the basis $(1,z_1,z_2,z_3)$ is
$$M^*= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &0&0&0\\
\rho^3+\rho^4 & \rho -\rho^4 & \rho^2 -\rho^3 & 0\\
\rho^2+\rho^4 & \rho^3 -\rho^2 & \rho -\rho^4 &0 \\
\rho^2+\rho^3 &0 &0 & \rho - \rho^2 -\rho^3+\rho^4
\end{bmatrix}.
$$ Remark that due to the non-transitivity of the action of $G$, the
bottom-right $3 \times 3$ submatrix of $M^*$, while invertible, does
not satisfy the assumptions of Lemma~\ref{signdet} (this matrix is
block diagonal, with blocks corresponding to $K(z_1,z_2)$ and
$K(z_3)$, for which the lemma applies).
